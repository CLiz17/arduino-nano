# Line-Following Robot using Arduino

**Description:**

This repository contains Arduino code for a line-following robot using the SparkFun TB6612 motor driver. The robot is designed to follow a line on the ground and implement PID control to stay on course.

**Features:**

- Two-wheel robot with individual motor control.
- PID control for accurate line following.
- Sensor calibration for optimizing line detection.
- Modular code structure for easy customization and extension.

**Setup:**

1. Connect your Arduino hardware with the SparkFun TB6612 motor driver and analog line sensors.

2. Upload the provided Arduino code to your device.

3. Follow the calibration procedure to set sensor thresholds.

**Usage:**

The robot follows lines on the ground, adjusting its motor speeds using PID control to stay centered on the line.

**Repository Contents:**

- `arduino_code.ino`: The Arduino code for the line-following robot.
  
**Getting Started:**

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Upload the `arduino_code.ino` to your Arduino board.

3. Follow the wiring instructions for the SparkFun TB6612 motor driver and line sensors.

4. Calibrate the sensors using the provided calibration function.

5. Observe the robot following lines with PID control.
